##Bare-metal virtual machine installation and usage##


####Hypervisor####
It is a software that allows multiple operating systems (OSs) to run concurrently on a physical machine and to interact directly with the physical hardware.

####Types of Hypervisor####
1. Hosted Hypervisor

For example:- VMWare Workstation


2. Bare-Metal Hypervisor

For example:-VMWare Exsi



Since nobody want to format their machines to install VMWare Exsi bare-metal hypervisor we are going to install it on VMWare Workstation hosted hypervisor and Kali linux OS on VMWare Exsi bare-metal hypervisor. It's like virtual machine on virtual machine. In my case VMWare Workstation 12.1.0. But the industrial practice is intall bare-metal hypervisor on newly bought machines and runs several virtual machines for seperate services.


For this tutorial I used,

1. VMware Workstation software installed on PC.
2. VMware ESXi bare-metal hypervisor iso file.
3. VMware vSphere Client software.(downloaded and installed)
3. Kali-linux Operating system iso file.

Let's begin the steps.



**step 01** - Open the VMWare Workstation software. In my case I already installed Workstation 12 PRO.

**step 02** - We have to create new virtual machine to install the VMWare Exsi as OS.

**step 03** - 
> Select Typical (recommended) option 

> Next button

**step 04** - Here we have to choose VMWare Exsi installer iso file. Choose,
> Installer disc image file (iso) option

> Browse button

**step 05** - You have to select VMWare-VMvisor-Installer 5.5.0.update02 and click,
> Open button

**step 08** - Here it's recommended for allocate at least 40GB of hard disk space. I allocated 60 GB space. Choose,
> Store virtual disk as a single file option

> Next button

**step 09** - New virtual machine specifications are displayed here. Click on,
> Customize Hardware... button

![](http://i.imgur.com/euvpUUP.png)



**step 10** - It's highly recommended to allocate at least 4 GB of RAM space. Make sure that your physical machine have at least 6 or 8 GB of RAM. Otherwise as my experience your virtual machine won't work in most cases.

![](http://i.imgur.com/T3v1ycL.png)



**step 11** - Set number of processors and number of cores per processor as your physical machine specifications. In my case single processor with 4 cores.
